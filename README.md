# B-Tree Key-Value Store

A disk-based key-value storage system built from scratch in C++ to learn fundamental systems concepts.


# Concepts to Learn As We Continue The Project
1. **B-Tree**: Self-balancing tree optimized for disk access
2. **Page-based storage**: Fixed-size blocks for efficient I/O
3. **Buffer pool**: LRU cache for frequently accessed pages
4. **WAL**: Ensuring durability and enabling recovery
5. **Concurrency**: Latches and locks for multi-threaded access
6. **Networking**: Socket programming and protocol design
